const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; 

const age = someCode(BIRTHDAY);
In contrast, age is evaluated in run-time. Today we have one age, a year after we’ll have another one. It is constant in a sense that it does not change through the code execution. But it is a bit “less of a constant” than birthday: it is calculated, so we should keep the lower case for it.
